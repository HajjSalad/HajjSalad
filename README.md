## 🛠️ Projects
### Smart IoT Control and Monitoring System
✅ Simulated analog sensor data on STM32 HAL (PWM, ADC) and transmitted to ESP32 via UART with handshake.<br>
✅ Built a modular, object-oriented IoT system on ESP32 using FreeRTOS for real-time task scheduling, modeling and 
   managing a scalable network of sensors and devices across multiple rooms for efficient control and monitoring.<br>
✅ Enabled Wi-Fi on ESP32 and implemented HTTP protocols to transmit sensor data to AWS IoT Core, storing it in AWS 
   Timestream for real-time monitoring, analytics, and remote control.<br>
Skills: 

### Traffic Light Control System
✅ Developed a real-time Traffic Light Control System on STM32 using a finite state machine (FSM) for dynamic 
   signal timing based on vehicle presence and count.<br>
✅ Implemented bare-metal firmware with direct register access to optimize system responsiveness without an RTOS.<br>
✅ Utilized GPIO interrupts to capture vehicle events, GPIO outputs to control RGB LEDs to simulate traffic signals.<br>
Skills: 

### Predictive Maintenance Data Logger
✅ Developed a real-time data logging system on STM32 using Zephyr RTOS, collecting real-time sensor data.<br>
✅ Implemented the Factory Method design pattern for modular creation of machines and sensors, ensuring scalability.<br>
✅ Integrated TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers to perform on-device anomaly detection, enabling early equipment
   failure prediction hence minimizing unplanned downtime.<br>
Skills: 

### Smart Fire Detection System 
✅ Built a scalable fire detection system using FreeRTOS with STM32 as sensor node and ESP32 as central fire panel.<br>
✅ Implemented OOP design patterns to manage six modular sensors with clean abstraction and dynamic behavior.<br>
✅ Implemented SPI communication between STM32 and ESP32 for real-time data transfer and cloud integration.<br>
