## 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Hajj - an **Electrical Engineering** graduate with a Computer Science minor from UBC. I’m passionate about building reliable, efficient, and scalable systems that bridge hardware and software.

#### 🚀 What I bring to the Table:
✔️ **Electrical Engineering**: Deep understanding of circuit theory, microelectronics, and signal processing for practical designs.  
✔️ **Digital Systems Design**: Experience with digital logic, processor architecture, and HDL for FPGA and ASIC development flows.     
✔️ **Low-Level Programming**: Expertise in embedded C/C++, Bare-metal and RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr) for real-time systems.   
✔️ **MCU Development**: Hands-on experience with STM32, ESP32, TM4C, ARM Cortex-M (register-level & HAL programming).     
✔️ **Hardware-Software Integration**: Proven experience in sensor/peripheral interfacing (SPI, I2C, UART) and system bring-up.  
✔️ **Modular Firmware**: Implemented scalable systems using design patterns (Factory, Abstract Factory, State Machines).  
✔️ **Edge-to-Cloud Solutions**: Developed AWS IoT-connected embedded devices, and Terraform-managed cloud infrastructure.
