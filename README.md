# Hajj Salad

## 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Hajj - an Embedded Systems and Firmware enthusiast with a background in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from UBC. I’m passionate about building reliable, efficient, and scalable systems that bridge hardware and software.

#### 🚀 What I bring to the Table:
✔️ **Low-Level Programming**: Expertise in embedded C/C++, Bare-metal and RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr) for real-time systems.   
✔ **MCU Development**: Hands-on experience with STM32, ESP32, TM4C, ARM Cortex-M (register-level & HAL programming).     
🔹 **Hardware-Software Integration**: Proven experience in sensor/peripheral interfacing (SPI, I2C, UART) and system bring-up.   
✔️ **Edge-to-Cloud Solutions**: Built AWS IoT-enabled devices using MQTT, Terraform for deployment.  
✔️ **Scalable Architecture**: Applied design patterns (Factory, Abstract Factory, State Machines) in firmware  

🔍 **Looking For:**  
I'm pursuing opportunities to work on mission-critical embedded systems, where continuous learning meets real-world impact - whether in firmware development, IoT solutions, systems engineering, or anywhere along the hardware-software interface.
