## 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Hajj - a Computer Engineering professional with an Electrical Engineering degree and Computer Science minor from UBC. I specialize in building reliable, high-performance embedded systems that bridge hardware and software, from bare-metal firmware to Linux kernel drivers.

**🚀 What I Bring to the Table**   
##### Embedded Systems & Firmware Development:
- Expert in embedded C/C++ across bare-metal and RTOS environments (FreeRTOS, Zephyr)
- MCU development on ARM Cortex-M platforms (STM32, ESP32, TM4C) with register-level and HAL programming
- Real-time multithreaded architectures with deterministic synchronization (mutex, semaphore, producer-consumer patterns)
- Event-driven firmware design for low-latency, resource-constrained systems  
**Systems Programming & Linux:**
- Linux kernel driver development (custom device drivers, IOCTL interfaces, V4L2)
- User-space/kernel-space communication and hardware abstraction layers
- POSIX sockets, TCP/IP networking, and HTTP server implementation
- System-level debugging and performance optimization  
**Hardware Design & Integration:**
- PCB design in KiCAD: schematic capture, mixed-signal routing, power integrity
- Peripheral interfacing (SPI, I2C, UART, ADC, PWM, GPIO, Timers)
- Hardware bring-up, system integration, and fault-tolerant communication protocols
- Test equipment proficiency: oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, multimeters, function generators
**Software Architecture & Scalability:**
- Object-oriented design patterns (Factory Method, Abstract Factory, State Machine)
- Modular firmware architectures for scalable fleet deployment
- Distributed systems design: edge-to-cloud telemetry pipelines
- Version control (Git), documentation (Doxygen), and build automation (Make, CMake)
**Edge Computing & Cloud Integration:**
- AWS IoT integration with Terraform-managed infrastructure
- On-device machine learning (TensorFlow Lite) for anomaly detection
- MQTT protocol implementation for IoT connectivity
- Real-time data streaming and remote monitoring systems
