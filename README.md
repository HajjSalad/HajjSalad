## 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Hajj - an Embedded Systems and Firmware enthusiast with a background in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from UBC. I’m passionate about building reliable, efficient, and scalable systems that bridge hardware and software.

#### 🚀 What I bring to the Table:
✔️ **Low-Level Programming**: Expertise in embedded C/C++, Bare-metal and RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr) for real-time systems.   
✔️ **MCU Development**: Hands-on experience with STM32, ESP32, TM4C, ARM Cortex-M (register-level & HAL programming).     
✔️ **Hardware-Software Integration**: Proven experience in sensor/peripheral interfacing (SPI, I2C, UART) and system bring-up.  
✔️ **Modular Firmware**: Implemented scalable systems using design patterns (Factory, Abstract Factory, State Machines).  
✔️ **Edge-to-Cloud Solutions**: Developed AWS IoT-connected embedded devices, and Terraform-managed cloud infrastructure.  

#### 🛠️ Notable Projects & Skills:
🚦 Traffic Light Control System: `STM32`, `C`, `Bare-metal`, `GPIOs`, `Interrupts`, `Finite State Machine`, `RGB LEDs`.  
🚨 Smart Fire Detection System: `STM32`, `ESP32`, `C/C++`, `FreeRTOS`, `SPI`, `Abstract Factory Pattern`, `MQTT`, `Wi-Fi`, `AWS IoT`.   
🌐 IoT Control and Monitor System: `STM32`, `ESP32`, `C/C++`, `HAL`, `PWM`, `ADC`, `Timers`, `OOP`, `UART`, `MQTT`, `Wi-Fi`, `AWS IoT`.    
📔 Embedded AI For Predictive Maintenance: STM32, C/C++, Python, Zephyr, Factory Method Pattern, TensorFlow Lite, Edge Computing.  

🔍 **Looking For:**  
I'm pursuing opportunities to work on mission-critical embedded systems, where continuous learning meets real-world impact - whether in firmware development, IoT solutions, systems engineering, or anywhere along the hardware-software interface.
